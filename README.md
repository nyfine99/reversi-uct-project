# reversi-uct-project
This a project I built in CMSC474, Computational Game Theory, at the University of Maryland. In this project, I implemented the UCT algorithm for a (slightly modified) version of reversi. The code for the game was provided by the instructor, and I built the UCT algorithm to play it. players/ordinary.py contains the UCT algorithm, while players/improved.py contains my improved version of the UCT algorithm, which was tested against the ordinary UCT algorithm under various constraints and consistently outperformed it (approximately 60% of the time, according to experiment data). The improved algorithm placed third in a competition with improved algorithms from other classmates; the class size was about 30 students.
