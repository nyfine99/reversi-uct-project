# reversi-uct-project
This contains files for a project I built in CMSC474, Computational Game Theory, at the University of Maryland. In this project, I implemented the UCT algorithm for a (slightly modified) version of reversi. The code for the game was provided by the instructor, and I built the UCT algorithm to play it.
